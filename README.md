## ðŸ“‹ Description
Lace - Patient monitoring and follow-up system


Our proposal for the new normality is to be able to have a system that allows to avoid agglomerations in the hospitals and to have a heat map of sick patients. That allows us to be prepared for any epidemic or outbreak of diseases and at the same time improve patient care by avoiding trips to a physical location.

This project consists of 2 parts a Control Panel Web and a virtual assistant by Whatsapp.

The flow starts when the hospital requests a patient to be monitored by this system. The user to start using the system has to send a "Greeting"
 to a certain number of Whatsapp. Immediately you will be answered by our virtual assistant that will indicate the actions the patient can perform or a registration link for those who are not registered.

This virtual assistant has 2 important functionalities :

Answering frequent questions.
Perform a daily survey to a patient, in order to know the patient's status as soon as he or she answers the questions.

What is used for as an answer sheet is a PDF that thanks to the use of Adobe's Sign we can complete and at the same time sign it. With this last step we can ensure the veracity of the answers.


And from the administrator's side that would be staff of a hospital, will have access to an entire control panel where they can view all patients who are monitored by the virtual assistant, display a heat map of confirmed patients with any disease, PDF files with the answers and signatures of users and metric numbers as the number of responses per day, etc.

Currently this is a prototype system that meets the basic requirements and is designed to not only help us have even more controlled diseases such as COVID-19, but other diseases.
